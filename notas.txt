# Seguimiento de Avance App - Plan

## Notes
- App will be a static web app suitable for GitHub Pages.
- Simple password protection (e.g., 'lotex2025') required; not highly secure.
- Users log in with password and select a username from a list (editable table).
- Each access logs date/time, geolocation (lat/lon), and username.
- App will allow viewing metrics of progress (by point, location, activity, day, etc.).
- App will allow uploading/updating progress, modifying an Excel (xlsx) file.
- Changes to progress are saved back to GitHub (by updating the Excel file).
- Special logic for point marking: replanteos (R suffix), new points (N suffix), and discarding points with reasons.
- User provided sample Excel and TXT files for data structure reference.
- All logic must be client-side (JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS) due to GitHub Pages limitations (no backend).
- The app will be called "Supervisiones X".

## Task List
- [x] Analyze sample Excel/TXT to define data structure.
- [ ] Design static web app architecture (frontend-only, no backend).
- [ ] Implement simple password gate and username selection.
- [ ] Implement access logging (date, time, lat/lon, username).
- [ ] Create UI for progress visualization and metrics.
- [ ] Create UI for submitting/updating progress.
- [ ] Implement logic for replanteos, new points, and discards.
- [ ] Implement Excel file reading/writing in browser (using libraries like SheetJS).
- [ ] Implement GitHub integration for updating Excel file (likely via GitHub API or manual PR/download/upload flow).
- [ ] Containerize/build app for deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Current Goal
Design static web app architecture (frontend-only, no backend).
